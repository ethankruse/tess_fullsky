# TESS Full Sky Mosaic
This repo contains the code used to create a full-sky mosaic of NASA's TESS full frame image data.
Included in this is corner glow modeling to remove the increased background light observed in the corners of
the cameras and produce an image with a more uniform background everywhere.
